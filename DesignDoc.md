# scRNA-Seq Mouse Heart Project - Design Document

## Overview
The overall goal of our project is to build a pipeline to analyze scRNA-Seq data from the mouse heart. We are aiming to quantify and compare the expression levels of genes that are known to be implicated in muscle contraction.

The general workflow is as follows:
1. Retrieve data from GEO
2. Quantify relative expression levels of genes
3. Select for muscle cells, filtering out other cell types, by utilizing the expression levels of muscle marker genes
4. Retreive the expression levels of 20-30 muscle contraction genes (specifically in the muscle cells), then sort and write them to an output file.
