# Assessing Gene Expression Homogeneity in Mouse Heart Sarcomeres: scRNA-Seq Analysis Mouse Heart

# Overview
This project utilizes scRNA-Seq data from the mouse heart, which was collected by the Barefield Lab (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132658). Our overall goal is to build a pipeline that assesses the level of homogeneity exhibited by the muscle tissue of the heart. **For detailed project design information, see the Design Document in the Wiki tab.**
