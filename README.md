# Assessing scRNA-Seq Cluster Heterogeneity in the Mouse Heart

# Overview
This project utilizes scRNA-Seq data that characterizes RNA expression in the mouse heart (Barefield et al.). Our overall goal is to build a pipeline that assesses the level of homogeneity present in the muscle tissue of the mouse heart. For detailed project design information, see DesignDoc.md.
