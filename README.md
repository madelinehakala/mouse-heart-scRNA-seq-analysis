# Assessing scRNA-Seq Cluster Homogeneity/Heterogeneity in the Mouse Heart

# Overview
This project utilizes scRNA-Seq data from the mouse heart, which was collected by the Barefield Lab (https://www.barefieldlab.org). Our overall goal is to build a pipeline that assesses the level of homogeneity exhibited by the muscle tissue of the heart. For detailed project design information, see DesignDoc.md.
